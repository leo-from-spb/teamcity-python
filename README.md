# TeamCity Python Runner

This project is a TeamCity Python runner.

I've authored this plugin in 2011 in spite of the day 
for running python scripts without problems of locating Python binaries 
on different platforms.

However, that times have changed, and now I don't support this plugin.  

TeamCity since the version **2020.2** has a new 
bundled **[Python Runner](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/2020.2/python.html)**
that supports also virtual env, test reporting, etc.
